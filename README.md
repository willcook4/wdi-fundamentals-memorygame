Will Cook's Memory Game: Unit Homework for WDI Fundamentals

This game was built to apply JavaScript concepts covered in the [pre-work](http://fundamentals.generalassemb.ly/), all pre-work lessons worked towards building a memory game app. My development of this game will exercised my ability to implement logic with JavaScript and so much more!

This is a work in progress and I think the following changed would make it better:

- When 2 cards not matching are flipped the pop-up happens before the face is seen.
- The cards are only 2 types, ie. only queen of hearts. Would be more realistic with more suits
- more cards to increase game difficulty
- random order of cards on the board
- more interesting background
- more interesting game play, cards rotate slightly on flip etc.
- Remove browser pop-ups and have them in the game window

Thanks for having a look,

Will
